OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Most critical security risks that repeatedly cause real-world data breaches

 OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021) — the most widely used standard 
 
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

1.	Broken Access Control

Users can access data or functions they shouldn’t (IDOR, privilege escalation).

2.	Cryptographic Failures
   
Sensitive data exposed due to weak or missing encryption (passwords, tokens).

3.	Injection
   
Malicious input alters queries or commands (SQL, NoSQL, OS command injection).

4.	Insecure Design
	
Security flaws caused by poor architecture or missing threat modeling.

5.	Security Misconfiguration
   
Default settings, open admin panels, unnecessary services, verbose errors.

6.	Vulnerable & Outdated Components
	
Using libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

7.	Identification & Authentication Failures
   
Weak login systems, brute force, session hijacking, poor password handling.

8.	Software & Data Integrity Failures
   
Untrusted updates, CI/CD pipeline attacks, insecure deserialization.

9.	Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
    
Attacks go unnoticed due to poor logging and alerting.

10.	Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    
Server is tricked into making malicious internal requests.

Why OWASP Top 10 Matters

•	Used by pentesters, SOC analysts, and developers

•	Foundation for DVWA, Juice Shop, Mutillidae

•	Frequently asked in interviews & certifications

Most critical security risks that repeatedly cause real-world data breaches (based on incident reports, breach analyses, and OWASP trends) are these 

Most Critical Security Risks Behind Real-World Breaches

1️ Broken Access Control

1 cause of massive breaches

•	Users access other users’ data (IDOR)

•	Privilege escalation (user → admin)

Real impact: Customer data leaks, account takeovers

 Seen in: APIs, cloud apps, SaaS platforms
 
2️ Credential Attacks & Weak Authentication

•	Password reuse

•	No MFA

•	Brute force & credential stuffing

 Real impact: Entire systems compromised
 
 Seen in: E-commerce, social media, enterprise portals
 
3 Injection Attacks (SQL / Command / NoSQL)

•	Unsanitized user input

•	Dynamic queries

 Real impact: Full database dumps
 
 Seen in: Legacy apps, internal tools
 
4️ Security Misconfiguration

•	Public cloud storage

•	Default credentials

•	Debug mode enabled

 Real impact: Sensitive data exposed without hacking
 
 Seen in: AWS S3, Docker, Kubernetes
 
5️ Vulnerable & Outdated Components

•	Old libraries with known CVEs

•	Unpatched frameworks

 Real impact: Remote code execution
 
 Seen in: Log4Shell-style incidents
 
6️ Cryptographic Failures

•	Plaintext passwords

•	Weak hashing (MD5, SHA-1)

•	Hard-coded secrets

 Real impact: Password leaks, identity theft
 
 Seen in: Databases, backups
 
7️ Phishing & Social Engineering

Still the easiest attack vector

•	Fake login pages

•	Malicious attachments

 Real impact: Initial access for ransomware
 
 Seen in: Corporate email systems
 
8️ Insecure APIs

•	No rate limiting

•	Broken authorization

•	Excessive data exposure

 Real impact: Silent mass data leaks
 
 Seen in: Mobile apps, fintech, startups
 
9️ Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

•	Attacks go unnoticed for months

 Real impact: Larger breach scope
 
 Seen in: SMBs and legacy enterprises
 
10 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

•	Cloud metadata access

•	Internal network abuse

 Real impact: Cloud account takeover
 
 Seen in: Cloud-hosted applications
 
Key Reality

Most breaches don’t use “advanced hacking.”

They exploit basic, repeatable security mistakes.
